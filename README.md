# MCP Agentic AI (Local DevOps Agent)

A **local-first Agentic AI system** built using **Ollama**, **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, and a **tool-using DevOps agent**.

This project demonstrates how to build **real agent systems** (not chatbots) that:
- Reason about problems
- Discover and call tools via MCP
- Inspect real system state
- Run fully offline on your local machine
